I finished my PhD in University of New South Wales (UNSW Syndey) in Feb 2022. My PhD research topic is short- and long-term behaviour of timber-timber composite (TTC) system. During my study, I colaborated with many well recognized researchers such as [A/Prof Hamid Valipour](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/hamid-vali-pour-goudarzi) at UNSW Sydney and [Dr. Stefania Fortino](https://cris.vtt.fi/en/persons/stefania-fortino) at VTT Finland.

From May 2021, I joined [Digitise Consulting](https://digitiseconsulting.com/) as a Graduate Ditigal Specialist. I was involved in several infrastructure projects in NSW such as M6 Stage 1, Great Western Highway, Mamre Road. In July 2022, I joined [WSP in Australia](https://www.wsp.com/en-AU) as a Digital Engineer in WSP Digital. 

Research interests: **Innovative timber structures, Finite element modelling, Digital Engineering, Deep learning**
